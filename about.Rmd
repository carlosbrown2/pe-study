## Introduction
There are two major types of Pulmonary Embollism that present in patients, Saddle and Non-Saddle. For low risk patients, defined here as submassive, is there a difference in adverse event rates between Saddle and Non-Saddle patients? We would also like to investigate the predictive power of traditional risk stratifiers like sPESI / PESI, and compare to BOVA Score.

## Definitions
- Within this study, the term adverse event rate and adverse event count are synonymous.
- PE = Pulmonary Embollism
- Submassive refers to patients with PE Severity of 1 or 2. A score of 3 indicates Massive.
- In the 2x2 tables, 1 indicates an adverse event, 0 indicates no adverse event
